# 1c-code

This repository contains the code from my quantitative analysis for my 1c project.

My code is as follows:
- **paragraph_level_valence.ipynb** (jupyter notebook for my first NLP method)
- **word_embedding.ipynb** (jupyter notebook for my second NLP method)
- **nlp_tools.py** (library I wrote containing various utility / data analysis functions)
- **subject_verb_object_extract.py** (library I found <a href="https://github.com/rock3125/enhanced-subject-verb-object-extraction">here</a> for a specific function)
- **scraping.ipynb** (notebook with web-scraping code)
- **connot_frames.ipynb** (notebook for an additional method I did, but didn't have time to include)
- **nearest_neighbours.ipynb** (notebook for another additional method I did, but didn't have time to include)

The data folder contains the original dataset I downloaded from figshare (UKdataset.xlsx) and the two csv files I split it into. Within the data folder are also the following sub-folders:
- **corpus** (stores the content of scraped articles)
- **lexicon** (stores the lexicon files used in my NLP analysis)
- **word2vec** (stores the Word2Vec models generated by my word embedding analysis)
